You should end up with a folder structure like below.\n/drydock-business - /drupal - /vm  Configure DrupalVM Modify the config.yml file located inside the vm folder. You will need to change the local_path to point to the project files on your computer.\nvagrant_synced_folders: - local_path: ~/work/web/drydock-business // enter the full path to your project directory  Run Vagrant From the vm folder you can now run Vagrant.\nvagrant up If for any reason the deployment fails, running vagrant provision will often fix the issue.\n Visit The Website Visit drydock-business.local in the browser! You should see the default Drupal 8 website.\nImport Data Choose between two methods to complete the Drydock installation. This will enable the theme, but more importantly import content types, blocks, views and content.\nMethod 1: SQL Import Importing the SQL file is the fastest and easiest method to configure the site and achieve the exact look and feel as the demo. Note you need to run MySQL from within the Vagrant box.\nFrom the vm directory ssh into Vagrant\nvagrant ssh  Navigate to the folder which includes the drydock.sql file.\ncd /var/www/drupalvm/drupal/sql  Import the database. DrupalVM has already created a database called drupal.\nmysql -uroot -proot drupal \u0026lt; drydock.sql  Finally, clear the Drupal cache. Executing Drush commands must be done from the /web folder.\ncd .. cd web drush cr all  Exit the SSH session.\nexit  Visit drydock-business.local in the browser. The website should be fully provisioned and look like the demo website. This ends the installation process on your local machine.\nMethod 2: Configuration Syncronization Method 2 uses the new Drupal 8 configuration management system. Site configuration data that is stored in the database, can now be imported and exported as code. The potential is huge, but there are still many quirks to the process. We recommend you read the Drupal configuration management docs for an overview.\nFor the Drydock theme, we\u0026rsquo;ve included the site configuration files. So instead of importing SQL you can import the configuration files to provision the fully completed site.\nFrom the vm directory ssh into Vagrant\nvagrant ssh  Drush commands must be executed from within the /web folder.\ncd /var/www/drupalvm/drupal/web  Install and enable the Drydock theme.\ndrush en drydock -y drush config-set system.theme default drydock -y  Set the default homepage node.\ndrush config-set system.site page.front /node/1 -y  Sync the configurations UUID.\nOne of the quirks of configuration management is that the UUID of your Drupal site must match the UUID in the configuration files. When you install a fresh copy of Drupal locally, and then recieve configuration files that have been exported from a different Drupal installation (different databases) you will need to sync the UUID.\ndrupal config:export:single --name=system.site --no-interaction drupal config:export:single --name=shortcut.set.default --remove-uuid --remove-config-hash --no-interaction  Import the configuration\ndrush config-import -y  Visit drydock-business.local in the browser. The website should be fully provisioned and look like the demo website. This ends the installation process on your local machine.\nGenerate Dummy Content When the theme is first installed, it automatically creates default content for key pages including \u0026lsquo;homepage, services, work, team, testimonials, about us, contact us\u0026rsquo;\nTo generate dummy content for each content type use devel_generate in the Drupal admin.\nOr use drush on the command line.\ndrush generate-content 20 --types=service drush generate-content 20 --types=work drush generate-content 20 --types=team drush generate-content 20 --types=testimonial  "
